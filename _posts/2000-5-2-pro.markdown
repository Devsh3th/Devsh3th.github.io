* Developed a system to manage queues at the billing counter of retail stores.
* Used Computer Vision to monitor the queue and a notification was sent to the store manager whenever queue exceeded its predefined threshold.
* Analyzed various factors that lead to queue exceeding its limit and helped stores to manage the queues which would increase the sales by 50%.
